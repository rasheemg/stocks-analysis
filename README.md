Helping Steve with stock analysis 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

In this project I helped Steve perform an analysis on a variety of stocks from 2017 and 2018. I created a worksheet to help Steve run the analysis as needed. I've also included buttons where he can prompt for the worksheet to be cleared and repopulated. This analysis will be helpful for Steve as he looks to evaluate which stocks performed the best between 2017 and 2018.

## Results

The analysis demonstrates that most of the stocks in 2017 performed very well. In 2018 most of the stocks had drastic drops in returns. There are only two stocks that remained positive although the returns were lower than the previous year. 
After refactoring the code, I found that the results are identical, but the results came back significantly faster than the original all stock analysis. The results came back over 6 times faster than the original search. Based off these results you can determine you'll get accurate results much quicker with the refactored code. See images below.

## Summary

I found refactoring the code challenging. The advantage was that I was able to refer to the “All Stocks Analysis” exercises and use the comments to guide which code I should use, but there were too many nuances at times that required editing and re-editing the code. I would imagine this would be more difficult for someone else who is not familiar with the code. They could be at risk for making more errors and taking more time to complete the refactoring even though it took me a very long time and I was familiar with the code. 

The biggest challenge I had was trying to solve the error of an Overflow. I recall in lesson 2.1.4 that we learned newer software will catch and stop the code but based on the instructions I should have enough space using Long to capture the value.
